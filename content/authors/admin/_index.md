I take pleasure in continuous learning and exploring new facets of life. Analytical by nature, I am a strategic thinker, highly focused, responsible, and a technology enthusiast.

My background includes robust hands-on technical experience, complemented by a deep understanding of the payments domain. I am passionate about automation as a means to avoid repetitive work and optimize processes, all while maintaining a steadfast commitment to ensuring quality. My main focus lately has been on modernizing testing practices, solving complex problems and the building and delivering platforms and tools at enterprise scale.

I strive to stay abreast of evolving technologies. I am a certified Kubernetes Application Developer and an AWS Certified Solutions Architect.
