summary: If you're navigating the complexities of microservices and seeking effective testing strategies, this session will provide valuable insights to empower your team in achieving the desired benefits of rapid, independent deployments.
abstract: "As teams embark on the journey towards microservices architecture, the promise of swift and independent deployments becomes a driving force. However, the transition often hits roadblocks when relying heavily on traditional end-to-end testing strategies. While providing a high level of confidence, these strategies can impede deployment frequency, create inter-team dependencies, and diminish team autonomy.Join me as I delve into Discover Financial Services' experience in modernising our systems, the bottlenecks we encountered, and how we are attempting to overcome them by adopting contract testing. Discover the diverse contract testing strategies and tools that played a pivotal role in our journey, and witness how this approach not only removed bottlenecks in our CI/CD pipeline but also fostered a culture of agility and autonomy.If you're navigating the complexities of microservices and seeking effective testing strategies, this session will provide valuable insights to empower your team in achieving the desired benefits of rapid, independent deployments."
